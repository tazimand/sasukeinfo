      🌌 <strong>Who is Sasuke Uchiha?</strong> <br />
      Sasuke Uchiha is one of the main characters in <em>Naruto</em>, the
      legendary anime and manga series created by Masashi Kishimoto. He is the
      last surviving heir of the Uchiha clan after a tragedy that shattered his
      childhood 😢🔥 <br /><br />

      👶 <strong>Childhood & Tragedy</strong><br />
      Sasuke was born in the prestigious Uchiha clan, one of the most powerful
      in the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha) 🏯 His older brother, Itachi Uchiha,
      was a prodigy and Sasuke idolized him. But one night, everything fell
      apart 😱 Itachi slaughtered the entire Uchiha clan, including their
      parents, and left Sasuke alive... <br />
      He said to him: “If you wish to kill me… hate me… detest me… and survive
      in an unsightly way. Run, run and cling to life…” 😈<br />
      From that moment, Sasuke vowed to become strong enough to kill Itachi. His
      heart turned cold 🥶<br /><br />

      🌀 <strong>Team 7 & Konoha Days</strong><br />
      Sasuke became a shinobi and was placed in Team 7 with: Naruto Uzumaki 🍥
      (his rival/friend), Sakura Haruno 💕 (who loved him), and Kakashi Hatake
      🐶 (their sensei). At first, he was calm, cool, and incredibly talented —
      but his hatred for Itachi consumed him. Even as he grew stronger alongside
      Naruto and Sakura, his obsession twisted his path 😤⚡<br /><br />

      🐍 <strong>The Curse & Orochimaru</strong><br />
      Sasuke sought more power than Konoha could give. He turned to Orochimaru,
      the snake sannin 🐍, who offered him strength in exchange for his body and
      soul 💀 He left Konoha... betraying his friends 😔 Naruto chased him,
      leading to the iconic Valley of the End battle 💥 But Sasuke, filled with
      hate, chose the darkness 🌑<br /><br />

      ☠️ <strong>Revenge Fulfilled</strong><br />
      He trained under Orochimaru, grew terrifyingly strong, and ultimately
      killed Itachi in an epic fight 🗡️ But the truth broke him… 😨 Itachi had
      killed the clan on Konoha's secret orders, to prevent a coup that would’ve
      caused war. He sacrificed himself as a villain to protect the village —
      and Sasuke. 😭<br /><br />

      🌀 <strong>From Avenger to Enemy</strong><br />
      With his mind shattered by the truth, Sasuke turned his hatred toward
      Konoha itself. He joined forces with Obito and later Madara, becoming a
      true rogue ninja 💀 Even so… Naruto never gave up on him 💔🍥<br /><br />

      🌀 <strong>Final Battle: Naruto vs. Sasuke</strong><br />
      Sasuke sought to create a new world by destroying the current one —
      becoming Hokage through revolution 🧨 Naruto stood in his way, determined
      to save his friend 💥 Their final clash at the Valley of the End shook the
      very earth. Both were left bleeding and broken — but finally, Sasuke
      understood. Naruto's love and determination reached him... 🫂💫<br /><br />

      ✨ <strong>Redemption & Legacy</strong><br />
      Sasuke returned to Konoha, atoning for his sins. He chose a life in the
      shadows — protecting the village from afar. He married Sakura, and they
      had a daughter: Sarada Uchiha 🥹🖤 Sasuke became a legend — a rogue
      protector, a shadow Hokage, a symbol of redemption ⚔️🖤<br /><br />

      🧠 <strong>Summary: Who is Sasuke?</strong><br />
      A boy fueled by pain 🔥<br />
      A man torn between revenge and truth ⚖️<br />
      A shinobi who fell to darkness and rose from it 🌑☀️<br />
      Naruto’s brother not by blood, but by fate 💙
